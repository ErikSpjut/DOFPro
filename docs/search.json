    "text": "Introduction\nThe High Power Rocketry materials were developed for the Harvey Mudd course E178, High Power Rocketry. This course grew out of the rocketry version of E80, Experimental Engineering which ran from Spring 2008 through Spring 2016. The course was converted to underwater autonomous vehicles for Spring 2017. The current E80 website is linked here.\nFor the Degrees of Freedom version, we are converting the website from being oriented as a course to being a tutorial on High Power Rocketry as defined in NFPA 1127 and by [TRA](https://www.tripoli.org/) and [NAR](https://www.nar.org/). The extensive code base in MATLAB is being rewritten in Python with NumPy and SciPy. The Mathematica code base is being rewritten in SageMath. The Microsoft Excel spreadsheets are being converted to LibreOffice. The RockSim models have all been converted to Open Rocket. The extensive SolidWorks files are all being converted to FreeCAD. We haven’t yet forund a good alternative for LabVIEW. Any copyrighted references are being replaced with creative commons or other open source references. We will also be filming instructional videos as well as converting the existing rocket construction web pages.\nWe have the initial website for the High Power Rocketry materials up. It is currently a very rough skeletal outline. Do not count on the URL to remain constant, as we may change it. Please just use it to get an idea of our current thinking."

    "text": "The Degrees of Freedom Project (DOFPro) was founded to take previously developed proprietary instructional information and convert it to be released under an open source license. The two sets of instructional information are in the areas of Chemical and Thermal Processes, and High Power Rocketry. The existing information was produced for Engineering classes at Harvey Mudd College. You can examine the existing websites and videos for the classes following the links below. In Chemical and Thermal Processes the links are E82, Chemical and Thermal Processes, E133, Chemical Reaction Engineering and E134, Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics. In High Power Rocketry, the link is E178, High Power Rocketry.\nOur chosen web development platform is Quarto. The chosen open-source packages are:\n\nLibereOffice\nPython with NumPy and SciPy.\nSageMath\nFreeCAD\nDWSIM\n\nwith the possibility of other packages to be added.\nYou can read more about the Chemical and Thermal Processes work at the link above, or go to the current Chemical and Thermal Processes website, which is in a very early state of development.\nYou can read more about the High Power Rocketry work at the link above, or go to the current High Power Rocketry website, which is in a very early state of development.\nIf you would like to join our team, please submit two samples of your work, chosen from the List of Samples page."

    "text": "Introduction\nChemical and Thermal Processes starts with the basics of stoichiometry and thermodynamics as covered in many Introduction to Chemical Engineering courses. It continues with topics typically covered in an advanced Engineering Thermodynamics course and in a Chemical Reactor Engineering course. The course material tied to copyrighted texts and commercial software was developed over a number of years, but development accelerated during the end of the 2019/2020 academic year, and the 2020/2021 academic year. During this time, the COVID pandemic forced the need for remote and asynchronous instruction for students stuck at home in almost every state in the United States and other countries throughout the world.\nThe existing course websites, with links to the videos, are:\n\nE82, Chemical and Thermal Processes\nE133, Chemical Reaction Engineering\nE134, Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics\nThe Stats parts of E80\n\nWe are planning on rescripting and reshooting all of the videos, reorganizing and rewriting the websites, and converting all of the examples, problem sets, projects, and solutions to creative commons and open-source software.\nWe have the initial website for the Chemical and Thermal Processes materials up.

    "text": "Introduction\nWould you like to contribute to the Degrees of Freedom Project? We have need of people with skills in the areas listed below. Please choose two of the sample tasks, e.g., Number 2 under Scripts, and Number 1 under Software and CAD Conversion, and submit a sample of your work to us for each of your two chosen tasks.\n\n\nScripts\nThe prinicipal tasks in the area of scripts are rewriting existing scripts, writing new scripts, and editing existing scripts, and storyboarding. The available sample tasks are:\n\nRewrite the linked portion of this script for an existing video to make it clearer and more accessible to students trying to learn chemical and thermal process principles. You may assume that the visuals can be changed.\nWrite a short script for a video to explain either the differences among total internal energy \\((U)\\), specific internal energy \\((\\hat{U})\\), and molar internal energy \\((\\hat{U})\\) in Chemical Engineering, or the coefficient of drag, \\(C_D\\) for a rocket.\nRecommend some edits to the linked script to make it clearer and more accessible to students trying to learn chemical and thermal process principles.\nStoryboard the linked script.\n\n\n\nGraphics Production\nGraphics Production involves many aspect of the project. We need title screens for the videos, logos for the videos and the websites, storyboards for the scripts, creation of the visuals for the videos and websites, and other elements of the graphic design for the websites and videos. The available sampel tasks are:\n\nCreate an overall logo for DOFPro.\nCreate a logo for the Chemical and Thermal Processes website.\nCreate a logo for the Rocketry website.\nCreate a title screen for the What Is a Mole? video.\nCreate a reveal.js presentation for slides 3 and 4 (page 2) of the linked presentation.\nRecreate the process flow diagram (PFD) in the linked problem with your choice of open-source software.\nCreate a 2D animation of the process flow diagram (PFD) in the linked problem. Have the reactor, heat exchanger, and distillation columns dissolve in one-by-one, and then the flow streams, and then trace the flow of propylene through the flow sterams and processing units.\nCreate a 3D animation of a tank with a feed pipe filling with a liquid.\n\n\n\nRecording and Editing\nWe have a large number of videos to record and all aspects of the recording and editing process will need to be done: lighting, staging, setting up sound equipment, operating the cameras, acting, editing the videos, editing the audio, mastering and final production, and posting. The available sample projects are:\n\nLight and photograph an interesting object.\nCreate a prop for use in a chemical and thermal processes or rocketry video.\nRecord a short video of someone explaining what internal energy is and include at least one transition.\nRecord a short video of someone singing, then optimize the sound quality, e.g, use an expander to drop the noise floor, a compressor to narrow the dynamic range, an equalizer to balance the frequency response, and some reverb to enhance the sound (just to clarify, e.g. means for example, it does not mean in other words).\nMake a short video that shows proper use of at least three of the following:\n\nStandard cut\nJump cut\nCrossfade\nWipe\nJ- or L-cut\nFade-in or fade-out\n\nMake short audio recording of someone speaking in a noisy environment and provide before-and-after samples of applying compression and expansion and/or other effects to optimize the noise reduction and audio quality. Explain how you did it.\n\n\n\nWebsite Production\nWe are creating and editing the websites in Quarto and posting on github. VS Code is the recommended development environment. Quarto uses Markdown for most of the text editing and Mathjax (LaTeX) for equation editing. We are creating our presentations in Quarto using the revealjs format. The sample tasks in website production are:\n\nConvert the linked webpage into a Quarto “.qmd” document that will render correctly (but not necessarily identially). Adding “?noformat” to the end of the URL may make your task much easier.\nConvert the linked presentation (PDF version) (Keynote version) (Powerpoint version) to a Quarto presentation using the revealjs format and render it in PDF.\nUsing css, change the linked webpage (link) (source) so that the table values are in a red serif font and the links are in a green italics serif font.\nProvide a step-by-step expalation of how you would set up and organize a team to use Quarto and Github with VS Code collaboratively edit a website and track all changes to the code base.\n\n\n\nProblem Set and Example Conversion\nMany of the example problems, homework problems, and projects are currently tied to copyrighted textbooks and commercial software. All of them need to be converted to problems releasable under creative commons and reference open-source software. The sample tasks in this section are:\n\nEither convert or describe the process for converting the linked assignment (.docx) (.pdf) to be releasable under creative commons.\nEither convert or describe the process for converting the example in Slides 14 through 18 (slides) (video starting at 10:08) to be releasable under creative commons.\nEither convert or describe the process for converting the linked project to be releasable under creative commons.\n\n\n\nSoftware and CAD Conversion\nWe have lots of example solutions, assignment solutions, projects, and CAD files that need to be converted from commercial software to open source. We have decided that we are going to make the following conversions:\n\nMicrosoft Excel files to LibreOffice files\nMATLAB code to Python with NumPy and SciPy code\nMathematica code to SageMath code\nSolidworks files to FreeCAD files\nPRO/II files to DWSIM files.\n\nThe sample projects available in software and CAD conversion are:\n\nConvert the linked spreadsheet from a “.xlsx” file to a “.ods” file and preserve as much of the formatting as possible.\nConvert the linked “.m” file into a “.py” file. The data file it processes is linked here.\nConvert the linked “.nb” file into SageMath code.\nConvert the linked “.SLDPRT” file into an “FCStd” file.\nConvert the linked “.prz” to a “.dwxmz” file."
